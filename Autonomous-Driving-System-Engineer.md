NVIDIA is hiring System Engineers for its Autonomous Vehicle teams. As a member of our team you will be responsible for developing and maintaining software to drive the car, given various sensor input devices including Camera’s, LIDAR, RADAR, GPS, IMU and others on Vehicle CAN, work with different teams here to transform the information into driving the car with the best experience. You will work with different teams on all sort of challenging problems for autonomous driving including computer vision, deep learning, object tracking, car controlling. You will help build the software and make it work flawlessly and safely on our driving platform. You are expected to have strong communication, organizational, and analytical skills. Solid understanding and strong System software experience is a requirement. Experience with GPU technology, image processing, computer vision, and multimedia are highly valued. Familiarity with deep learning / artificial intelligence is desirable.

#### What you’ll be doing:
- Craft the driving application for Autonomous Vehicle products
- Solve the real challenging problems in the software with different teams and to drive the car with the best experience
- Performance optimization on our driving platforms

#### What we need to see:
- You have a BS/MS in EE/CS or closely related field (or additional equivalent experience), and 5+ years of relevant work and lab experience.  
- You possess a good understanding of programming languages in C, C++ and Python.
- You are familiar with source control tools (git, Perforce, etc.)
- You are experienced in developing system software mostly in user space but also feel no big deal in digging deep into kernel space and even low-level hardware
- You know much system programming, threading, mutex, synchronization, communication, and parallel computing to build highly scalable and efficient applications
- You are familiar with underlying hardware architecture for CPU/GPU and memory, and understand performance from bottom up
- Prior experience working in the following areas: Kernel development, Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics, Self-Driving-Cars, GPU technology, Computer Vision, Deep Learning
- You should display outstanding communication and collaboration skills, as we work as a tightly-knit team, always discussing and learning from each other and driving things forward and making solid progress

#### Ways to stand out from the crowd:
- Deep understanding of system architecture, CPU/GPU/Memory/Storage, everything related to performance optimization
- Solid working experience in kernel developing, Linux/QNX, and all too familiar with OS scheduling, event handling, real-time requirements.
- Experience with Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning or other Artificial Intelligence paradigms
- Experience in Automotive Vehicle or Robotic System Building
- We believe that realizing self-driving cars will be a defining contribution of our generation (e.g. traffic accidents are responsible for ~1.25 million deaths per year world-wide). We have the funding and scale, but we need your help on our team.

###### NVIDIA is widely considered to be one of the technology world’s most desirable employers. We have some of the most brilliant and talented people in the world working for us. If you're creative, autonomous and love a challenge, we want to hear from you!
